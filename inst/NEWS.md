Changes in Version 1.4.1 (2024-09-23)
========================================================
* Fix for `toBibLaTeX` and `toBibTeX` non-ASCII name list fields. Add escape
hatch if `tools::encoded_text_to_latex` fails to convert name lists to valid
LaTeX (observed for Japanese names in #106 h/t @kijinosu, Andy Bunn).
* Add argument `encoded.names.to.latex` to `toBibTeX` and `toBibLaTeX` to
toggle whether `tools::encoded_text_to_latex` is called on name list fields 
(requested in #105)
* `retmode` is no longer automatically specified as "medline" in `ReadPubMed`, which
seems to decrease the likelihood of Bad Request/400 errors. It can still be specified
by the user via `...`

Changes in Version 1.4.0 (2022-09-30)
========================================================

* Package `bibtex` back in Imports and no longer used conditionally
in `ReadBib()` since it's now back on CRAN.
* Fixes for `ReadPDFs()` (#95).
* `useBytes` is now `FALSE` in all `sub`, `grep`, etc. calls in all
package functions.
* Fix for `GetPubMedByID()` with multiple book results (#86).
* Remove comma preceeding "et al" in `Cite`, `Citep`, etc. calls (#84)
* Add support for custom bibtypes with custom bibstyles (#83)


Changes in Version 1.3.0 (2020-11-13)
========================================================

* Package `bibtex` moved to Suggests in `DESCRIPTION` due to it
currently being orphaned on CRAN. Work is underway by the ROpenSci
team to rectify this. The package can still be installed from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ROpenSci/bibtex). In the event that
`bibtex` is not installed, the functions `ReadBib()`,
`GetBibEntryWithDOI()`, `ReadCrossRef()`, and `ReadZotero()` 
throw an appropriate message asking the user to install `bibtex` and invisibly
return `NULL`.
* The old CrossRef API can no longer be used. If `use.old.api` is set
  to \code{TRUE} in \code{ReadCrossRef()}, it will be ignored with a warning.
* `GetDOIs()` had to be removed due to changes to the CrossRef API. It
  will hopefully return in the next release.
  

Changes in Version 1.2.13 (2019-04-03)
========================================================

## BUG FIXES

* When working in single-byte locales, the `print` method for
`BibEntry` objects is more robust against accented characters being
converted to incorrect ones when `bib.style = "authoryear"`. 
Additionally, for this style, a period could be removed
from the last initial in the first author's given name when
`first.inits = TRUE`. This has been corrected.

Changes in Version 1.2.12 (2019-04-02)
========================================================

* The serial comma is now used when formatting name lists

## BUG FIXES

* Fix issue that could lead to Unicode characters being
converted to latin1 when printing (h/t joaochenriques #62)
* Fix issue with extracting DOI from CrossRef results
in `GetDOIs`
* Fixes for `ReadCrossRef` when `use.old.api` is `TRUE`. Scores
are sometimes not returned by the API call and when this occurs
the entries will now be added to the output `BibEntry` object with
a message indicating that no score was available.
* A comma no longer appears before "et al." when the `max.names`
options is set to `1` (h/t davidaknowles #56)

Changes in Version 1.2.8 (2018-12-10)
========================================================

## BUG FIXES

* Fix extraction of citation counts in `ReadGS` that was occasionally 
causing errors from some `scholar.id`s (h/t Miao Sun, #59)
* Fix printing of thesis and report entries types in authoryear style
when "type" field missing (h/t Hugo Grunson, #58)
* Fix for `PrintBibliography` for the case of `BibEntry` objects with
  a single entry, an NA value could appear next to the year in the
  output (#60)
* Fix issue that could lead to Unicode characters being
converted to latin1 when printing (h/t joaochenriques #62)

Changes in Version 1.2.2 (2018-05-31)
========================================================

## BUG FIXES

* `GetPubMedByID` is better at extracting years and months
from the results returned by NCBI Entrez (h/t Dale Steele #52)
* The `as.data.frame`method for `BibEntry` objects now correctly
handles the case of a single entry with name list fields containing multiple 
names (h/t Damon Bayer #51)

Changes in Version 1.2.0 (2018-04-24)
========================================================

## NEW FEATURES

* `+.BibEntry` and `merge.BibEntry` gain an argument ignore.case,
which defaults to `BibOptions()$ignore.case` (`TRUE`) so that case is 
ignore when checking for duplicate fields (h/t Justin Calabrese #47)
* Improved warning message when printing entries with unknown 
LaTeX macros (the entry key is now included). (h/t Justin Calabrese #49)
* The entry key is now included in warning messages when entries are 
missing fields and `BibOptions()$check.entries == "warn"` (h/t Justin
Calabrese #48)

## BUG FIXES

* Entries are now only checked once to ensure all required
  fields are present in `ReadBib`

Changes in Version 1.1.0 (2018-04-02)
========================================================

* `PrintBibliography` gains parameters "start" and "end"
to allow for printing only a subset of all cited entries from
a BibEntry object (h/t Joseph Casillas #45, #46)


Changes in Version 1.0.0 (2018-02-19)
========================================================

* Use https for all links (h/t Katrin Leinweber)
* Use preferred DOI resovler (h/t Katrin Leinweber)

Changes in Version 0.14.21 (2017-09-05)
========================================================

## BUG FIXES

* Package peer reviewed and accepted by rOpenSci (h/t Noam Ross, 
Carl Boettiger, and Amelia McNamara)

## BUG FIXES

* Remove missing plot from Rhtml vignette
* URL field returned by `GetBibEntryWithDOI` is now decoded properly
* Fix hyperlinks from bibliography to citations in vignettes
* Remove a incorrect message occasionally output from the addition
operator for `BibEntry` objects

Changes in Version 0.14.12 (2017-06-30)
========================================================

## NEW FEATURES

* Package now uses httr, xml2, jsonlite packages instead of RCurl,
XML, RJSONIO for scaffolding
* No more R CMD check NOTE regarding foreign function call to bibtex
(h/t Romain Francois)

## BUG FIXES

* Correct parsing of interval dates when creating unique labels for
authoryear style citations
* `c.BibEntry` throws an error if not all objects are `bibentry` objects
* Fix typos in documentation
* Literal ampersands are now printed correctly (not as '\&') (h/t Yue Hu)
* Ensure BibTeX month macros are processed properly by lubridate

* Unescape special characters in URL fields returned by CrossRef (h/t
  Michael Schubert)
* Remove square brackets from custom entry type names (h/t Hugh
  Parsonage)

Changes in Version 0.13.1 (2016-11-14)
========================================================

## BUG FIXES

* Feature involving `LaTeX` macros added in package version 0.12.0 can
only be used for R 3.3.z and higher; this corrects cause of failed
checks on R 3.2.z


Changes in Version 0.13.0 (2016-11-09)
========================================================

## BUG FIXES

* Updated calls to NCBI Entrez for functions `ReadPubMed`,
`GetPubMedByID`, etc.  to use https as now required by NCBI (h/t Dale
Steele and Anthony Crane)
* Change reference to www.omegahat.org to www.omegahat.net (h/t Kurt Hornik)
* Documentation for `ReadPubMed` is updated to reflect that the
default number of entries returned (controlled by the argument
`retmax`) is 20 (h/t Dale Steele)

Changes in Version 0.12.0 (2016-09-30)
========================================================

## NEW FEATURES

* Some `LaTeX` macros unknown to R are now defined as macros in the
package, and will be parsed using `macros` arg in `tools::parse_Rd`
(assuming `getRversion() >= "3.2.0"` Note: corrected in 0.13.1 to be
`getRversion() >= "3.3.0"`)

## BUG FIXES

* Parse `LaTeX` macro `\textquotesingle` in author names (h/t Bill Denney)
* Avoid "Request-URI too large" errors in GetPubMedByID if requesting a large number
of IDs (h/t Maurits Evers)

Changes in Version 0.11.0 (2016-09-10)
========================================================

## NEW FEATURES

* `ReadCrossRef` now uses the
[newer CrossRef API](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md) 
and gains arguments `filter` and `offset` to use with the new API; an
additional argument `use.old.api` is added if the user wishes to use
the old API (h/t Carl Boettiger)
* `ReadCrossRef` now parses the results returned by CrossRef to create
the `BibEntry` object when using the new API; for the old API (and
hence, older versions of the package) the query only returns DOIs and
`ReadCrossRef` would then use the DOIs to request the corresponding
BibTeX entries from CrossRef (i.e. less HTTP requests when using the
new API)

## BUG FIXES

* Fix generation of entry keys when the word used from the title for key
generation contains a non-ascii character (h/t Mark Johnson)
* RefManageR will no longer hang due to a bug in `tools::latexToUtf8`
([PR\#17138](https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17138)) that
is occasionally encountered when that function processes an unknown
macro (h/t Eric Bryant)
* Entries with no title field can now be printed without error when
`BibOptions()$check.entries` is *not* set to "error" (default is "error")

Changes in Version 0.10.15 (2016-06-06)
========================================================

## BUG FIXES

* Removed unnecessary use of local/parent.frame; fixes execution with
bytecode compiler (h/t Tomas Kalibera)

Changes in Version 0.10.12 (2016-03-25)
========================================================

## BUG FIXES

* Fixed broken test involving `ReadPDFs` due to changed URL (h/t Kurt
  Hornik)
* `as.data.frame.BibEntry` works for length one BibEntry with multiple
authors  (h/t Dale Steele)
* Use `httr::GET` to fix `ReadGS`
* Fixed broken tests in `test-authors.R` owing to changes to `person` class
* Fixed `ReadCrossRef` tests and error message
* Fixed printing for authoryear style (h/t Joseph Casillas)
* Name list fields (author, editor, etc.) provided to the function `BibEntry` are
now properly parsed when specified as they would be in BibTeX/BibLaTeX;
e.g. `author = "Smith, Bob A. and Doe, Jane"`. 

Changes in Version 0.10.5 (2016-01-03)
========================================================

* The 'key' field in `BibEntry` objects is now always enforced to be unique
* `as.data.frame.BibEntry` is faster and now works if duplicate keys are
present; keys in  (h/t Dale Steele)
* Fix for `ReadCrossRef` if downloaded BibTeX had leading whitespace
(h/t Carl Boettiger)
* `useBytes = TRUE` used for all calls to `grep`, `sub`, etc. (h/t
  HI&RH Lord Ripley of England)
* remove use of deprecated function `lubridate::new_interval`
* updated URL for the BibLaTeX manual
* Fix test in test-search.R that broke because of new year (h/t HI&RH
  Lord Ripley of England)
* add additional functions from utils and stats to NAMESPACE

Changes in Version 0.9.0 (2015-06-10)
========================================================

* Use `bibtex >= 0.4.0.9000` function `do_read_bib` to avoid
`.External` call and `R check` note (request of HI&RH Lord Ripley of
England)

Changes in Version 0.8.63 (2015-06-08)
========================================================

## NEW FEATURES

* Improve parsing of dates in `ReadPDFs`
* Citations using `Cite` family of functions can now be `pandoc`
style, e.g. `[@abibkey]` by setting `BibOptions(cite.style =
"pandoc")` (h/t Dale Steele)
* Added note about locales when parsing string 'month' fields to
`ReadBib` help page (h/t Dieter Menne)

## BUG FIXES

* Fixed merging `BibEntry` objects by multiple fields when no duplicates
* `open.BibEntry` fixed to not use partial matching of field names;
e.g. an error would occur if the specified entry had a 'urldate'
field, but no 'url' field
* `open.BibEntry` will `message` and not throw error if entry cannot
  be opened
* Fixes for `ReadPDFs` when argument `use.metadata` is `FALSE`
* Fix for `ReadPDFs` when when reading *one* file which is a JSTOR pdf
* Fix for sorting by volume (`BibOptions(sorting = "anyvt")` and
  `BibOptions(sorting = "nyvt")`
* Fix for sorting by label (`BibOptions()sorting` equal to  "anyvt" or "anyt")
* `GetBibEntryWithDOI.R` will not `stop` if an error occurs
downloading any of the DOIs (e.g., if one entry in the `doi` vector
has a typo and the rest are valid)

Changes in Version 0.8.52 (2015-01-26)
========================================================

## NEW FEATURES

* `GetPubMedByID`: Now returns some additional fields including
'month' and 'issn' for articles; will print a warning if PubMed does
not return the complete list of authors; will use the name of a
collective if one is available and the individual authors are missing
(h/t Dale Steele)

## BUG FIXES

* `ReadBib`: If a name list field in an entry cannot be parsed in the bib file, the
entry will be ignored, but the rest of the file will still be processed and
returned. In the past, this caused an error and no output would be returned.
* 'Book' entries will now be parsed correctly by `GetPubMedByID` (h/t
  Dale Steele)
* Fix error/warning messages when entry is missing required fields (bug introduced in
Version 0.8.45)
* Name lists containing a comma in braces will now be parsed
correctly, e.g. "Buchalter, Louis and {Murder, Inc.} and Anastasia,
Albert"

Changes in Version 0.8.45 (2014-12-29)
========================================================

## BUG FIXES

* `ReadCrossRef` now correctly handles the small number of cases where
BibTeX information cannot be obtained for a particular DOI, which
resulted in 'stack imbalance' warnings and no results being returned
(h/t Norman L Guinasso Jr).
* `ReadGS` fixed to account for changes to Google "API" (h/t Norman L
  Guinasso Jr).
* Improved parsing for BibTeX format names ending with a '}' (h/t Henrik Bengtsson).
* Printing references with `style = "html"` would not always add an
opening <cite> tag when `bib.style = "numeric"` or `bib.style =
"alphabetic"` (h/t Henrik Bengtsson).
* `format.BibEntry` would ignore the `.style` argument if called
directly by the user.  Note, this function should normally not need to
be called directly. (h/t Henrik Bengtsson)

Changes in Version 0.8.40 (2014-10-28)
========================================================

## NEW FEATURES

* Improved formatting of citation given to CrossRef for increased
chances of finding matches with `GetDOIs` function (h/t Erich
Studerus)
* Additional parsing of 'month' field to accomodate days and ranges of
days and months.  Example bib entries that will be parsed correctly
include `month = jun # "/" # jul`, `month = "20~" # jan`, `month =
"20==25~" # dec`, `month = "10~" # jan # "/" # feb` (request of
Stephen Eglen)
* Added argument 'group' to `ReadZotero` for specifying a groupID to
query a group library instead of a user library (h/t Greg Blomquist).

## BUG FIXES

* DOI's hyperlinks in Markdown format are now correct (h/t Stephen Eglen)
* `print.BibEntry` with `BibOptions(style = "Biblatex")` fixed (h/t
  Artem Klevtsov)
* `unlist.BibEntry` and `RelistBibEntry` now retains `@strings` and
`mheader` and `mfooter` attributes (see ?BibEntry) if they are present

Changes in Version 0.8.34 (2014-08-18)
========================================================

## NEW FEATURES

* Added function `GetDOIs` which searches CrossRef for DOIs for the
citations stored in a `BibEntry` object

## BUG FIXES

* `ReadCrossRef` fixed to account for change to CrossRef API
  endpoint. (h/t Carl Boettiger)
* Abstracts returned by NCBI Entrez can be multiple parts.  This is
now handled correctly and the complete abstract will be returned in
the 'abstract' field. (h/t Erich Studerus)
* DOI's were too naively extracted from NCBI Entrez results, resulting
in some entries having 'doi' fields with length greater than one.  Now
fixed. (h/t Erich Studerus)

Changes in Version 0.8.32 (2014-08-14)
========================================================

## NEW FEATURES

* Functions for interacting with NCBI Entrez return abstract of each
  article (request of Erich Studerus)

## BUG FIXES

* `print.BibEntry` with `BibOptions(style = "citation")` now works properly
* Examples calling web resources should no longer upset the check farm
  (h/t HI&RH Lord Ripley of England)


Changes in Version 0.8.3 (2013-07-30)
=========================================================

## NEW FEATURES

* `as.BibEntry` will create entry key if given a `bibentry` object
with no key.  Useful when citing packages with `citation`.
* PrintBibliography and Cite functions (Cite, Citet, etc.) accept
`bibentry` objects in addition to `BibEntry` objects.
* `$<-.BibEntry` will now accept a single person object, so that a
single author in a multi-author entry may be updated.  An example may
be found at `help("$<-.BibEntry")`.  (h/t Carl Boettiger)

## BUG FIXES

* validated html
* changed example for `WriteBib` that occasionally failed check

Changes in Version 0.8.2 (2013-06-01)
=========================================================

## BUG FIXES

* Cite functions work if a specified entry has no key.  Note that keys
  should always be provided for all entries as they are required for
  all entries in a BibLaTeX bib file (h/t Carl Boettiger)
* Entries returned by Crossref that have entry type 'Data' which is
  not supported by default in BibLaTeX are converted to type 'Online'
  (h/t Carl Boettiger)
* Fix for `ReadGS` when argument `check.entries` is FALSE or "warn"
  (h/t Francisco Rodriguez Sanchez)
* Family names from Scholar in all caps are handled correctly in ReadGS

## NEW FEATURES

* Functions for interacting with PubMed return language of each
  article (h/t Dale Steele)
* Added CITATION file
