Changes in Version 0.8.33 (2014-08-17)
--------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* Abstracts returned by NCBI Entrez can be multiple parts.  This is now handled correctly and the complete
abstract will be returned in the 'abstract' field. (h/t Erich Studerus)
* DOI's were too naively extracted from NCBI Entrez results, resulting in some entries having 'doi' fields with
length greater than one.  Now fixed. (h/t Erich Studerus)

Changes in Version 0.8.32 (2014-08-14)
--------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Version 0.8.3 (2013-07-30)
---------------------------------------------------------

packages with `citation`.

`BibEntry` objects.
* `$<-.BibEntry` will now accept a single person object, so that a single author in a multi-author entry
