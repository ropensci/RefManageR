Description: RefManageR provides tools for importing and working with
    bibliographic references.  It greatly enhances the bibentry class by
    providing a class BibEntry which stores BibTeX and BibLaTeX references,
    supports UTF-8 encoding, and can be easily searched, updated, combined,
    printed in a number of styles, and exported.  Interfaces to NCBI's Entrez,
    CrossRef, and Zotero are provided for importing references and references
    can be created from locally stored PDFs using Poppler.  Includes functions
    for citing and generating a bibliography with hyperlinks for documents
    prepared with R Markdown or R HTML.
