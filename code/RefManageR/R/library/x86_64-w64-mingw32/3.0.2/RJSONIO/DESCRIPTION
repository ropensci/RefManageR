Package: RJSONIO
Version: 1.0-3
Title: Serialize R objects to JSON, JavaScript Object Notation
Description: This is a package that allows conversion to and from data
        in Javascript object notation (JSON) format.  This allows R
        objects to be inserted into Javascript/ECMAScript/ActionScript
        code and allows R programmers to read and convert JSON content
        to R objects.  This is an alternative to rjson package. That
        version was too slow for converting large R objects to JSON and
        is not extensible, but a very useful prototype.  It is fast for
        parsing.  This package uses methods, vectorized operations and
        C code and callbacks to R functions for deserializing JSON
        objects to R.  Verison 0.4 of this package uses a new native
        parser, implements the transformation code in C and allocates
        memory efficiently (rather than concatenating because of event
        driven parsing).  The result is a significantly faster parsing
        of large JSON documents.
Note: See http://www.json.org/JSON_checker/test.zip for tests. We now
        use code from the libjson project
        (http://libjson.sourceforge.net).
