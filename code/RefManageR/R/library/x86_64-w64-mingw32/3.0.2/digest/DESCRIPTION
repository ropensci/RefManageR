Title: Create cryptographic hash digests of R objects
Description: The digest package provides a function 'digest()' for the
        creation of hash digests of arbitrary R objects (using the md5,
        sha-1, sha-256 and crc32 algorithms) permitting easy comparison
        of R language objects, as well as a function 'hmac()' to create
        hash-based message authentication code.
 .
  The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the sha-1 and
        sha-256 algorithms are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2,
        and the crc32 algorithm is described in
        ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt.
 .
  For md5, sha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses a small standalone
        implementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For
        crc32, code from the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an
        implementation by Aaron D. Gifford is used.
 .
  Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed for
        cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely
        tested) libraries such as OpenSSL should be used.
