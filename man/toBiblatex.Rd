\title{Convert BibEntry objects to BibTeX or BibLaTeX}
\usage{
toBiblatex(object, encoded.names.to.latex = TRUE, ...)

\method{toBibtex}{BibEntry}(
  object,
  note.replace.field = c("urldate", "pubsate", "addendum"),
  extra.fields = NULL,
  encoded.names.to.latex = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class BibEntry to be converted}

\item{encoded.names.to.latex}{if \code{TRUE} (the default) then name list fields
such as \sQuote{author} and \sQuote{editor} will have non-ASCII characters
translated to LaTeX escape sequences by \code{\link{latexify}}.}

\item{...}{ignored}

\item{note.replace.field}{a character vector of BibLaTeX fields.  When converting an entry to BibTeX, the first field in the
entry that matches one specified in this vector will be added to the note field, \emph{if} the note field is not already
present}

\item{extra.fields}{character vector; fields that are not supported in standard BibTeX styles are by default dropped
in the result return by the toBibtex function.
Any fields specified in extra.fields will \emph{not} be dropped if present in an entry.}
}
\value{
an object of class \dQuote{Bibtex} - character vectors where each element holds one line of a BibTeX or BibLaTeX file
}
\description{
toBiblatex converts a BibEntry object to character vectors with BibLaTeX markup.  toBibtex will convert a BibEntry object
to character vectors with BibTeX markup, converting some BibLaTeX fields and all entry types that are not supported
by BibTeX to ones that are supported.
}
\details{
toBiblatex converts the BibEntry object to a vector containing the corresponding BibLaTeX file, it ensures the name
list fields (e.g. author and editor) are formatted properly to be read by bibtex and biber and otherwise prints all fields
as is, thus it is similar to \code{\link{toBibtex}}.

toBibtex will attempt to convert BibLaTeX entries to a format that can be read by bibtex.  Any fields not supported by
bibtex are dropped unless they are specified in \code{extra.fields}.  The fields below, if they are present, are converted
as described and added to a bibtex supported field, unless that field is already present.
\itemize{
\item date - The \code{date} field, if present will be truncated
to a year and added to the \code{year} field, if it is not already present. If a month is specified with the date, it will
be added to the \code{month} field.
\item journaltitle - Will be changed to journal, if it is not already present
\item location - Will be changed to address
\item institution - Converted to \code{school} for thesis entries
\item sortkey - Converted to \code{key}
\item maintitle - Converted to \code{series}
\item issuetitle - Converted to \code{booktitle}
\item eventtitle - Converted to \code{booktitle}
\item eprinttype - Converted to \code{archiveprefix} (for arXiv references)
\item eprintclass - Converted to \code{primaryclass} (for arXiv references)
}

If no \code{note} field is present, the note.replace.field can be used to specified BibLaTeX fields that can be looked for
and added to the note field if they are present.

BibLaTeX entry types that are not supported by bibtex are converted by toBibtex as follows
"mvbook" = "Book", "bookinbook" = "InBook", "suppbook" = "InBook",
\itemize{
\item MvBook,Collection,MvCollection,Reference,MvReference,Proceedings,MvProceedings,Periodical - to Book
\item BookInBook,SuppBook,InReference,SuppPeriodical - to InBook
\item report,patent - to TechReport
\item SuppCollection - to InCollection
\item thesis - to MastersThesis if \code{type = mathesis}, else to PhdThesis
\item \emph{rest} - to Misc
}
